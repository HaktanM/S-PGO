## Build the Code
```bash
cd S-DPVO
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake ..
cmake --build . -- -j$(nproc)
```


## TO DO
* Compute global poses inside the kernel. Torch is too slow :(
* It is much faster to compute $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{g}_\alpha$ in the first place rather than $\mathbf{J}_\alpha$. 
* Check cuBLAS
* What is the effect of the window size in a noisy case? Highlight the fact that we need larger pose graphs for more accurate pose estimations. 
* Check cuSolver
